## General Info
Keep easily track of your <b>money balance</b> at every <b>Monopoly game</b> of yours.

## Demo
By visiting the <i>balance.html</i> page you can:
* Modify the total amount of your money by typing the transaction amount you want to commit.
* Just add a minus symbol (-) before the amount to declare the subtraction. 
* Adding the plus symbol (+) in the case of addition is not necessary.
* Every transaction made is listed below the total money balance.

<b>Note</b> that refreshing the page resets the whole board!

If you want to start the game with a <b>different amount of money</b>, you can just add or subtract the amount you have in mind!
